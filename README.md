Project Name:

It's unclear from the image what the project name is. However, based on the data, it could be something like "Employee Payroll and Overtime Calculation" or "January Payroll Report."

Project Goal:

The primary goal of this project is to calculate and track employee payroll, including overtime hours and bonuses, for the month of January.

Data Used:

The project utilizes data on employees, their hourly wages, hours worked, and overtime hours for each week of January.

Key Calculations & Metrics:

Overtime Hours: Calculated for each employee based on hours worked exceeding the standard 40-hour workweek.
Overtime Bonus: Calculated based on the overtime hours worked, likely at a premium rate (e.g., 1.5x the hourly wage).
Total Pay: Calculated by summing the regular pay (hourly wage * hours worked) and the overtime bonus.
Gross Pay: This column appears to be the same as Total Pay, but it's unclear if there are additional deductions or taxes considered.
Project Methodology:

Data Collection: Employee data (name, hourly wage) and hours worked data were likely collected from various sources (e.g., time cards, employee records).
Data Cleaning: The data was likely cleaned to handle any inconsistencies or missing values.
Data Transformation: The data was likely transformed to calculate overtime hours, overtime bonuses, total pay, and gross pay.
Data Visualization: The data was presented in a tabular format for easy review and analysis.
Additional Notes:

The image doesn't show the formulas used for the calculations, which would be essential for understanding the project in detail.
The project appears to be focused on a single month (January). A more comprehensive project would likely involve tracking payroll data over a longer period.
There are some inconsistencies in the data formatting (e.g., inconsistent use of currency symbols, missing decimal points).
